# BookRecommendationSystem 

A book recommendation system that you can run on your own localhost. If you choose a book from the list, the site we created using pickle trains the data of users who have previously read and voted for the book you selected, with a machine learning model, and recommends similar books. 

A complete machine learning and data cleaning-processing project from start to finish.

PS: You should unzip the .zip files and bring them together in your projext files with the name of "env".
